<h1>About me!</h1>
<p>
  Passionate about cryptocurrency and dedicated to exploring new technologies, I
  am an enthusiast who thrives on innovation and forward-thinking. <br />
  With a background serving my country in the Portuguese Navy for seven years, I
  honed my leadership and organizational skills.
  <br /><br />Additionally, I pursued specialized training in accommodation and
  hotel management, blending my love for hospitality with a commitment to
  excellence. <br /><br />
  Furthermore, I undertook an intensive nine-week course at Ironhack in web
  development, where I tackled both individual and group projects with immense
  dedication. <br /><br />Throughout the program, I embraced challenges and
  collaborated effectively to deliver results. Culminating in a MERN (MongoDB,
  Express.js, React, Node.js) stack project, this experience enhanced my
  technical proficiency and problem-solving abilities. <br /><br />I am excited
  to leverage this diverse skill set to contribute to dynamic projects and drive
  meaningful innovation.
