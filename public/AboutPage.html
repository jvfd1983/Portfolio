    <h1 style="color: #333;">About me!</h1>
    <p style="color: #666;">
      Passionate about cryptocurrency and dedicated to exploring new technologies, I
      am an enthusiast who thrives on innovation and forward-thinking. <br>
      With a background serving my country in the Portuguese Navy for seven years, I
      honed my leadership and organizational skills.
      <br><br>Additionally, I pursued specialized training in accommodation and
      hotel management, blending my love for hospitality with a commitment to
      excellence. <br><br>
      Furthermore, I undertook an intensive nine-week course at Ironhack in web
      development, where I tackled both individual and group projects with immense
      dedication. <br><br>Throughout the program, I embraced challenges and
      collaborated effectively to deliver results. Culminating in a MERN (MongoDB,
      Express.js, React, Node.js) stack project, this experience enhanced my
      technical proficiency and problem-solving abilities. <br><br>I am excited
      to leverage this diverse skill set to contribute to dynamic projects and drive
      meaningful innovation.
